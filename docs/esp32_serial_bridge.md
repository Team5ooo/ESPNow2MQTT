# ESP32 Serial Bridge Functionality

This document details the functionality of the ESP32 unit acting as a serial bridge within the IoT network.

## Overview

The ESP32 serial bridge serves as an intermediary device, collecting data from multiple ESP8266 sensor nodes and relaying this information to a host computer (which then forwards it to an MQTT broker). It leverages ESP-NOW for incoming wireless communication and a serial connection for outgoing data.

## Key Responsibilities

1.  **Receiving Data via ESP-NOW:**
    *   The ESP32 is configured to receive data packets from one or more ESP8266 sensor nodes using the **ESP-NOW** protocol.
    *   It listens for incoming ESP-NOW messages. Each message typically contains sensor readings (e.g., temperature, humidity) and an identifier for the source ESP8266 sensor (often its MAC address).
    *   The ESP32 needs to be aware of the MAC addresses of the ESP8266 devices that are authorized to send it data, or it can be configured to accept data from any ESP-NOW sender. For better security and data integrity, registering specific sender MAC addresses is recommended.

2.  **Data Processing and Formatting (JSON):**
    *   Upon receiving a data packet from an ESP8266, the ESP32 processes the raw sensor data.
    *   It then converts this data into a structured **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format**. JSON is chosen for its human-readability and ease of parsing by various programming languages (like Python on the host machine).
    *   A typical JSON payload might look like this:
        ```json
        {
          "sensor_id": "A0:B1:C2:D3:E4:F5", // MAC address of the ESP8266
          "temperature": 25.5,
          "humidity": 45.2,
          "timestamp": 1678886400 // Optional: timestamp added by ESP32
        }
        ```
    *   The ESP32 might also add metadata, such as a timestamp of when the data was received or processed, or a unique ID for the bridge itself if multiple bridges were in use.

3.  **Sending Data via Serial Port:**
    *   Once the data is formatted as a JSON string, the ESP32 transmits this string over its **serial port** (typically via a USB connection to a host computer).
    *   The host computer runs a script (e.g., a Python script) that continuously listens to this serial port.
    *   The serial communication parameters (baud rate, data bits, parity, stop bits) must be configured consistently on both the ESP32 and the host computer's listening script.

## Advantages of using ESP32 as a Bridge

*   **ESP-NOW Capability:** The ESP32 natively supports ESP-NOW, making it ideal for receiving data from ESP8266 devices.
*   **Processing Power:** It has sufficient processing power to handle data from multiple sensors, perform JSON conversion, and manage serial communication simultaneously.
*   **Connectivity Options:** The ESP32 offers various connectivity options, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, although for this specific role, its primary interfaces are ESP-NOW (input) and Serial (output).
*   **Reliability:** Provides a stable link between the low-power ESP-NOW network and the more robust serial communication to the host machine.
